Image Classification Using CNN

Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The model processes images, learns patterns, and predicts the correct category (Cat or Dog) with high accuracy.

Purpose
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how CNNs, a powerful deep learning method, can efficiently solve image classification problems.

Dataset
1. Images: Labeled images of cats and dogs.
2. Preprocessing: Images are resized to 64x64 pixels, normalized, and augmented to enhance training.

Steps in the Project
1. Preprocessing: Prepare images for training.
2. Model Building: Create a CNN with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
3. Training: Train the model using the prepared dataset.
4. Evaluation: Check the model's accuracy on test data.
5. Prediction: Use the model to classify new images.

Technologies Used
1. Python
2. TensorFlow/Keras
3. NumPy
4. Matplotlib

Results
The CNN model successfully classifies images into cats or dogs, achieving good accuracy and reliable predictions.
